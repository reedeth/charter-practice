# Praxis Oath/Promise/Pledge/Creed:
> *(this part will be memorized)* 

We, the members of the Praxis Fellowship and Scholars’ Lab of the fifteen-sixteen academic year, in our explorations and explanations, in our obligations to one another and to those beyond our cohort, resolve:

To be respectful, patient, and generous;
* To delight in discoveries, old and new;
* To be accountable for our own work, and acknowledge the work of others;
* To present ourselves and our work mindfully and compassionately;

In our determinations to fulfill these resolutions, "shortcomings" will be viewed not as failure but rather as a bettering challenge.
